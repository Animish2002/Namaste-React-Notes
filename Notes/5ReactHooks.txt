ui layer and data layer work together in react they go hand in hand
react is fast bcoz it has faster dom manipulation

showing data with the ui dynamically it can be done with react hooks 

different react hooks => "normal js function which is provided by react (pre-built) written by facebook developers"
-useState() => superpowerfull react variables  (used to create state variables why state varible the name 
bcoz it maintains the state of the application/component)

-useEffect()

-All react hooks =>

//state variable declaration
  const [restaurantList] = useEffect([]);
