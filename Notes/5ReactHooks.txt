ui layer and data layer work together in react they go hand in hand
react is fast bcoz it has faster dom manipulation

showing data with the ui dynamically it can be done with react hooks 

different react hooks => "normal js function which is provided by react (pre-built) written by facebook developers"
-useState() => superpowerfull react variables  (used to create state variables why state varible the name 
bcoz it maintains the state of the application/component)

-useEffect()

-All react hooks =>

//state variable declaration
  const [restaurantList] = useEffect([]);   // this is nothing but array distructuring 

when ever the state variable updates the react rerenders(updates the ui) the component


///////Important concepts of react
The React Algorithm => it uses React Reconciliation Algorithm(also known as React Fiber)

React (Virtual-DOM)=> Not an actual DOM , but it just the representation of an actual DOM (object)

Diff Algorithm => It differentiates between the updated virtal dom and the previous virtual dom

Why react is fast?
bcoz it does efficient DOM manipulation, how? bcoz it has a virtual DOM ,
