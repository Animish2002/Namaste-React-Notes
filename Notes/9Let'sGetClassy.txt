class based components vd functional components

a classed based component is where class is been declared and extends React.Component is used 
inside which there is render method which return the jsx

State and Lifecycle Methods: Class-based components can hold and manage state using this.
state and can use lifecycle methods such as componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, 
and componentWillUnmount.

where as for 

functional based it is function that reaturns the jsx

use of props in class based component
1. declare a constructor and  pass props to it
constructor(props){
    super(props);
    console.log(props);
}

to call it use {this.props.name}

class based component did not hooks so how are state created
they are create when an instance of a class is been created
create state variables inside the constructor itself where we passed the props

creating other new state must be inside the this.state only
example:  this.state{
    count:0,
    count2:1,
}
here the state variable is a big object which contains all the state variables that are created ****important
