2. Updating     (if something is updated)
3. Un-Mounting  ()

//////////parent constructor                from parent to child lifecycle calling
//////////parent render
//////////child constructor
//////////child render
//////////child commponent did mount
//////////parent commponent did mount

1. Mounting Phases => 
a. constructor is mounted first when the component instance is created *(setting intial state)*
b. Render mounted 2nd the jsx is render on to the dom
c. ComponentDidMount method is mounted immmediately after the component is added *(Fetching data from an API.)*

2. Updating Phases =>
a. render method is called again to update the UI
b. ComponentDidMount method is mounted immmediately *(Fetching new data based on props changes)*

3. Unmounting Phases =>
a. commponentWillUnmount
