  return () => {  // This returns a new component here
    return (
      <div> {/* The new component returned */}

      </div>

for the higher order component

A controlled component in React is one where the component's state (such as the value of a form input)
is fully controlled by React via props and state. Instead of the component managing its own state 
internally, it receives its current value from its parent component and reports changes back to the 
parent. The parent component then updates the state, which in turn re-renders the child component 
with the updated state.
